Hej! I'm André Jørgensen, a bioinformatics engineer based in Hvidovre, Denmark. I recently completed the MSc Eng. in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology at DTU, where I focused on pangenomic alignment strategies for fragmented mitochondrial genomes. My happy place is somewhere between the wet lab and the scheduler queue—building analysis pipelines that are fast, reproducible, and easy for collaborators to reuse.

I spend most of my time crafting Snakemake-driven workflows, wrangling containers (Docker/Singularity), and pulling apart pangenomic graph toolchains to squeeze out better signal from low-quality DNA. When I’m not benchmarking aligners, you’ll usually find me poking at metagenomic datasets, tidying up documentation, or sketching HPC cluster diagrams on a whiteboard.

## What I’m working on

* **Pangenomic alignment research** – evaluating graph-based approaches for mitochondrial genomes with limited reference panels.
* **Reproducible HPC infrastructure** – packaging complex RNA/DNA analysis workflows so they run identically on DTU’s HPC, local workstations, and the cloud.
* **Data storytelling** – translating statistical results into clear figures and short narratives for collaborators in evolutionary genomics.

## Skills in practice

* Languages & tooling: Python, R, Bash, SQL, Snakemake, Nextflow, Git.
* Platforms: HPC/SLURM clusters, containerized workflows, cloud object storage.
* Methods: pangenomics, mitochondrial assembly, metagenomic profiling, QC/benchmark automation.

## Education snapshot

* **MSc Eng., Bioinformatics and Systems Biology** — Technical University of Denmark (2022–2024)
    * Thesis: *Optimizing Mitochondrial Genome Alignment using Advanced Pangenomic Techniques on HPC clusters*.
* **BSc, Biotechnology** — Technical University of Denmark (2018–2022)
    * Project: high-throughput transcript isoform annotation pipelines on HPC.

## Outside the lab

* Bouldering sessions to clear my head after long HPC runs.
* Board games and puzzles with the DTU community.
* Exploring palaeogenomics papers and speculative ideas about extinction dynamics.
